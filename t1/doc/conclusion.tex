\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a simple circuit using both node and mesh method has been achieved. The theoretical equations have been solved using \textit{Octave}, and the circuit simulation was obtained using \textit{Ngspice} software. The simulation results don't match precisely with the theoretical ones. In the node method, this is due to the fact that these tools use different numerical precision in their calculations. The same happens in the mesh method, however there's an increse in the deviation, because \textit{Ngspice} uses node method in it's calculations. Even though the two analysis don't match completely, given the small differences, we consider the results to be satisfying.
