\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a simple circuit using both node and mesh method has been achieved. The theoretical equations have been solved using \textit{Octave}, and the circuit simulation was obtained using \textit{Ngspice} software. The simulation results don't match precisely with the theoretical ones. This is due to the fact that these tools use different numerical precision in their calculations. However, the differences were negligible. The reason for this small errors is the fact that this circuit only contains linear components, so the theorethical and simulation results cannot differ very much. In conclusion, even though the two analysis don't match completely, given the small differences we consider the results to be highly satisfying.
