The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing resistors, linearly dependent voltage and current sources, a sinusoidal voltage source and a capacitor. The explained explained can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:cir_intro}

In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. More precisely, we study the circuit for $t<0$, find the equivalent resistor as seen from the capacitor terminals, the natural and forced solutions for $t>0$, as well as frequency response analysis.

In Section \ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, using \textit{Ngspice}, and we study the same as in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. The results are also compared to the theoretical ones. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
