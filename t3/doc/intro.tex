% state the learning objective
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to make an AC/DC converter, using resistors, capacitors and diodes. The built circuit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:cir_intro}.

In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. More precisely...

In Section \ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, using \textit{Ngspice}, and we study the same as in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. The results are also compared to the theoretical ones. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
