% state the learning objective
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to make an AC/DC converter, using resistors, capacitors and diodes. The built circuit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:cir_intro}.

In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. More precisely we used nodal analysis as well as incremental analysis on a equivalent circuit, to arrive to our results.
In Section \ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation, using \textit{Ngspice}, and we study the same as in Section \ref{sec:analysis}. The results are also compared to the theoretical ones. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

The values of the circuit elementes that we used for both the theorethical analysis and simulation can be seen in table \ref{tab:intro_values}.

  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline
        {\bf Variable} & {\bf Value} \\ \hline
        $n$ & 10 \\ \hline
        $R_1$ & 10 $k\Omega$ \\ \hline
        $C$ & 600 $\mu F$ \\ \hline
        $R_2$ & 6.0644 $k\Omega$ \\ \hline

Since the number of diodes used was 18, the total cost of this circuit was 616.2644 MU.
