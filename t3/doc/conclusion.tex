\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, it is seen that the results from both the theoretical analysis using \textit{Octave} and the circuit simulation using \textit{Ngspice} don't match exactly. This conclusion was already expected, this the diode models used for the theorethical analysis and the simulation were different. However, they did not differ too much, so we consider the results to be satisfactory.

So, in conclusion, we consider that the objective of making an AC/DC converter and analysing it was achieved.
