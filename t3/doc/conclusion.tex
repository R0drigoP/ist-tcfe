\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}



In this laboratory assignment, it is seen that the results from both the theoretical analysis using \textit{Octave} and the circuit simulation using \textit{Ngspice} seem to match, for both the static analyses for $t<0$ and for the calculation of boundary conditions, as well as for the natural and forced solutions of the system, and its frequency responses.
\par
So, in conclusion, we consider the objective of analysing both the static solution of this RC circuit with fixed applied voltage, and the time-dependent solution of the same circuit to be achieved.
