\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, it is seen that the results from both the theoretical analysis using \textit{Octave} and the circuit simulation using \textit{Ngspice} don't match exactly. This conclusion was already expected, since the diode models used for the theorethical analysis and the simulation were different. However, they did not differ too much, so we consider the results to be satisfactory. Also, of all the circuit elements values, the one presented was the one with the higher merit, and we think it was a decent value.

So, in conclusion, we consider that the objective of making an AC/DC converter and analysing it was achieved.
