\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, it is seen that the results from both the theoretical analysis using \textit{Octave} and the circuit simulation using \textit{Ngspice} don't match exactly. This conclusion was already expected, since the OP-AMP models used for the theorethical analysis and the simulation were different. However, they do not differ too much in some aspects as said in the previous section, so we consider the results to be satisfactory. The worst aspect of this circuit might be the fact that the output impedance is too high.

So, in conclusion, we consider that the objective of making a Band Pass Filter Amplifier and analysing it was achieved.
