\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, it is seen that the results from both the theoretical analysis using \textit{Octave} and the circuit simulation using \textit{Ngspice} don't match exactly. This conclusion was already expected, since the transistor models used for the theorethical analysis and the simulation were different. However, they do not differ too much in some aspects as said in the previous section, so we consider the results to be satisfactory. The worst aspect of this audio amplifier might be the fact that the output impedance is too high, and isn't perfectly compatible with the load.

So, in conclusion, we consider that the objective of making an Audio Amplifier and analysing it was achieved.
